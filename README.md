# sarcasm-detection
This project is based off the Kaggle competition for detecting sarcasm in forum comments: https://www.kaggle.com/c/umich-si650-sarcasm-classification. For this task, I utilized machine learning classifiers such as Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). I improved the performance of my classifiers by extracting features from the forum comments such as the number of upper-case letters, the number of repeating characters and the presence of exclamation points.
